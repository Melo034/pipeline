# ðŸŽ¯ DPG Criterion 1: Relevance to Sustainable Development Goals

## Overview

**DPG Requirement**: A digital solution as a whole, or its subcomponents must contribute to the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals. For example, a digital solution with a goal, mission or vision relevant to an SDG, or a digital solution that produces a data set relevant to an SDG would qualify. In either case, there must be clear intentions to further the SDG in question through your work.
